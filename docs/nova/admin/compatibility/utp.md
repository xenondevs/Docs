# UTP (work in progress)

[UTP](https://github.com/UnifiedTechPower) (**U**nified **T**ech **P**ower) is a combined effort of different
project maintainers to provide a common framework for plugins from the "mod-like" genre.

With the [unified](https://github.com/UnifiedTechPower/unified) library, we're planning to provide a common interface
for things like energy, items and blocks.

In the future, this library will provide compatibility with Slimefun, Space, and possibly even more plugins.

_Please note that the unified library is currently not yet implemented in Nova._
